# channel_messages 
Retrieves the messages in a channel. Returns an array of message objects on success.

If operating on a guild channel, this endpoint requires the current user to have the VIEW_CHANNEL permission. If the channel is a voice channel, they must also have the CONNECT permission.

If the current user is missing the READ_MESSAGE_HISTORY permission in the channel, then no messages will be returned
