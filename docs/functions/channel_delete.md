# channel_delete 
Delete a channel, or close a private message. Requires the MANAGE_CHANNELS permission for the guild, or MANAGE_THREADS if the channel is a thread. Deleting a category does not delete its child channels; they will have their parent_id removed and a Channel Update Gateway event will fire for each of them. Returns a channel object on success.
